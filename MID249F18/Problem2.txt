I would suggest abstracting the following methods in the Employee class: lessThan(), samePay().
This allows us to change these functions more easily if creating a new class.
Suppose we would like to create a class SalaryEmployee, we would be override those methods,
along with the other abstract method, getPay(), and they would be different functions from
those in the HourlyEmployee class. This is good because it is difficult to compare the pay
of two employees who are paid differently.

Another concern I have with this code is the equals() method in HourlyEmployee. It seems
as though the intent was to override the equals() method from Object, but it doesn't do
so properly. A quick fix would be to change the parameter other to be of type Object, and
then at every time it is referenced, cast it to an HourlyEmployee.
